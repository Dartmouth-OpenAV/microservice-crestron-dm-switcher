# Crestron DM Switcher
This microservice should work with the following Crestron devices, although only DM-MD8x8 was tested:  
- DM-MD8x8 
- DM-MD16x16 
- DM-MD32x32 

The following operations are supported:  
set **'avroute'**, set **'videoroute'**, get **'avroute'**, get **'videoroute'** using the same endpoint syntax as Kramer switchers.  
**'avroute'** and **'videoroute'** are essentially the same - audio follows video.
